  AtliQ _Hospitality_Analytics_Power BI Dashboard
- Domain: Hospitality | Function: Revenue
- Being part of this challenge conducted by Codebasics Team in the month of September, I have worked End to End in this project.

Problem Statement:- 
- AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
- Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
- As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
- Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
